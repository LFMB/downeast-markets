# About
Downeast Markets is based in Portland, ME and is founded by [Lucas Blom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasblom/). Lucas did a 5 year stint in NYC working for [Shift Markets](www.shiftmarkets.com) in their web operations department and he eventually became the product head for both their main web products: Start-a-Broker Web Package and Crypto/Fiat Currency Exchange Product. He has a strong base in product development, front-end and web architecture technologies, getting entrepreneurs to market, and working with global and distributed teams. He graduated cum laude from University of Massachusetts with a BA in Finance and Operations and is a self taught front-end developer. 

He is also impressed by Peak's Organics and Allagash's physical distribution network along the Northeast. He would love to help get more Maine craft beer (especially if it is not an IPA) and seafood to the NYC and its surrounding markets.
